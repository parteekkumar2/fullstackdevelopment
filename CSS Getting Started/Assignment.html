    <!-- Poem -->
    <P>
        I met a traveller from an antique land,<br>
        Who said-" Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br> 
        Stand in the desert... Nera them,on the sand,<br>
        Half sunk a shattered visage lies,whose frown,<br>
        And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br>
        Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br>
        Which yet survive,stamped on these lifeless things,<br>
        The hand that mocked them,and the heart that fed;<br>
        And on the pedetal,these words appear:<br>
        My name is ozymandias,king of king;<br>
        Look on my Works,ye Mightly, and despair!<br>
        Nothing beside remains.Round the decay<br>
        Of that colassal Wreck,boundless and bare<br>
        The lone and level sands stretch far away."<br>
    </P>
